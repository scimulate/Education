    "# Iteration Overview\n",
    "_Iteration_ is simply the process of repeating a task. Humans are not great at iteration (try counting to one-million without messing up), but computers perform iterative tasks superbly. In this lesson, we will learn about the two iterative approaches in Python.\n",

    "# ```while``` Loops\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The functionality of a ```while``` loop is simple, and similar to that of an ```if``` statement; the premise is that a block of code is executed when a condition is true, and that block of code is _repeatedly_ executed as long as the condition remains true. A basic example, counting from 0 to 9, is written below."

    "Here, ```count``` stores a variable which gets incremented. At first, the condition ```count <= threshold``` is evaluated. Since it evaluates to ```True```, the indented block of code executes in its entirety. Afterwards, the code _loops_ (hence the name) back to the top and evaluates the ```while``` condition again. This repeats until the condition evaluates to ```False```. Since ```count``` starts at zero and continually incremenets by 1, this ```while``` loop will certainly conclude.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note_: The statement ```count += 1``` is shorthand notation for ```count = count + 1```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most generic form of loop is the ```while``` loop; any other loop (Python has two loop varieties, but other languages have three of more) may be written as a ```while``` loop. Based on their structure, ```while``` loops are also the best approach when writing code that can iterate for an unknown duration.\n",
