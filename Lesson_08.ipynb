    "## Geometry Example\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is best described with an example. Suppose we wish to create a geometric model of a rectangle. Recall that a rectangle is fully defined by the edges of its two orthogonal lengths, ```height``` and ```width``` ('a' and 'b', respectively).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Procedural Programming Approach\n",
    "Now, with the knowledge that our model corresponds specifically to a rectangle, no other shape, we should be able to ascertain additional information directly from ```height``` and ```width```; for example, perimeter and area of a rectangle are common attributes that are fully defined from those two values."

    "## Object-Oriented Structure\n",
    "Using an OOP approach, since both attributes are inherent to a rectangle, they should therefore be inherent to a data structure which models a rectangle. We achieve this by building a ```Class``` called ```Rectangle```. A class contains all of the data necessary to fully-describe an object and methods to act on that object. A sample class, ```Rectangle```, has been written below."

    "Referring back to the ```Rectangle``` class creation, similar to how functions are created using the ```def``` keyword, classes are created using the ```class``` keyword. The ```self``` keyword is also scattered throughout the class. Unlike functions which require passing every required piece of data as an argument, class methods can make use of the ```self.*``` notation. For example, since we know each instance of ```Rectangle``` must be defined by a ```height``` and ```width```, those two values can be uniquely embedded in each instance of ```Rectangle``` and accessed by its methods.\n",
