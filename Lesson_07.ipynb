    "# Synopsis\n",
    "Python contains dozens of built-in libraries to expand the functionality of programs. Some have already been discussed, like ```math``` and ```random```, but others have not. A list of built-in modules may be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), but this is by-no-means a complete list of available functionality in Python. Third party modules are available for nearly every programming function imagineable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import Statements\n",
    "There are two common import structures to include functionality into a program, ```import``` and ```from```.\n",
    "## Full Module\n",
    "If planning to use many functions from a module, it is appropriate to import the full module. For example, programming a math calculator will use several functions from the ```math``` module, including ```sqrt()```, ```exp()```, ```sin()```, ```cos()```, ```tan()```, etc. To import the entire math module, simply place the following command at the top of your code."
